# AptAmigo Live Prototypes

This is a simple, static Express-based site for use on my team's partner project
at Startup Institute. The site hosts links to a set of modified versions of the
home page and property pages on the site, along with mocked-up prototypes, 
designed by Robin McKay (check out her work [here](http://robinmckay.co/ "Robin 
McKay's portfolio"))

The original home page can be found [here](https://www.aptamigo.com/ "AptAmigo's
home page") and the specific property page used as the template can be found 
[here](https://www.aptamigo.com/IL/Chicago/Apartment/optima-chicago-center 
"Optima Chicago Center Apartments property page").

The portal site can be found [here](https://gentle-refuge-94328.herokuapp.com/ 
"AptAmigo prototype portal page")

### Notes
Due to time and logistical constraints, some assets and functionality available 
on the original pages are not present. This includes the custom font used for 
rendering the stars in various reviews. While I attempted to minimize the number 
of missing assets and functionality, there is some un-rendered content on the 
prototype pages.

Additionally, due to hosting constraints on Heroku's free tier service, the 
portal site is only accessible for 18 hours of every day and may load slowly if 
it hasn't been accessed in the last 30 minutes. Specific details can be found on 
[Heroku's pricing page](https://www.heroku.com/pricing "Heroku pricing").
