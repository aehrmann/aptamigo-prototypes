# AptAmigo Live Prototypes

This is a simple, static Express-based site for use on my team's partner project
at Startup Institute. The site hosts links to modified versions of the home page
and property pages on the site, mocked-up prototypes (designed by Robin
McKay - check out her work [here!](http://robinmckay.co/ "Robin McKay's portfolio")),
along with a bare-bones contact form for testing the integration of a new
Customer Relationship Management system called [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/
"Zoho") (this integration was implemented by Jerry Lin, our team's back-end developer).

The original home page can be found [here](https://www.aptamigo.com/ "AptAmigo's
home page") and the specific property page used as the template can be found
[here](https://www.aptamigo.com/IL/Chicago/Apartment/optima-chicago-center
"Optima Chicago Center Apartments property page").

The portal site can be found [here](http://aptamigo-prototypes.herokuapp.com/
"AptAmigo prototype portal page")

### Notes
Due to timing and logistical constraints, some assets and functionality available
on the original pages are not present. This includes the custom font used for
rendering the stars in reviews and the slider for the unit galleries. Not having
access to the original Javascript and having to un-minify most of it myself, I
attempted to minimize the amount of missing functionality, but there are still
some pieces missing from prototype pages.

Additionally, due to hosting constraints on Heroku's free tier service, the
portal site is only accessible for 18 hours of every day and may render slowly if
it hasn't been accessed in the last 30 minutes. Specific details can be found on
[Heroku's pricing page](https://www.heroku.com/pricing "Heroku pricing").
